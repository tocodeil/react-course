/**
 * Lab 04:
 *
 * Implement a multi color picker component.
 *
 * Component should provide an <input> field to select a color,
 * and below 9 <div> elements.
 * Each <div> should have a slightly darker color than the previous one,
 * with the color selected by the user used as the middle color.
 *
 * See lab description on the website for a live demo.
 *
 * Hint: Use tinycolor library to perform color manipulations
 *
